/**
 * @title  Subnet Portfolio
 * @notice Receives messages from mainnet for deposits and sends withdraw requests to mainnet.  It also
   transfers tokens between traders as their orders gets matched.
 * @dev    Allows only the native token to be withdrawn and deposited from/to the subnet wallet. Any other
 * token has to be deposited via PortfolioMain deposit functions that sends a message via the bridge.
 * When the bridge's message receive event emitted PortfolioBridgeSub invokes processXFerPayload \
 * All tokens including ALOT (native) can be withdrawn to mainnet using withdrawToken that will
 * send the holdings back to the user's wallet in the mainnet. \
 * TradePairs needs to have EXECUTOR_ROLE on PortfolioSub contract. \
 * If a trader deposits a token and has 0 ALOT in his subnet wallet, this contract will make a call
 * to GasStation to deposit a small amount of ALOT to the user's wallet to be used for gas.
 * In return, It will deduct a tiny amount of the token transferred. This feature is called AutoFill
 * and it aims shield the clients from gas Token management in the subnet.
 * It is suffice to set usedForGasSwap=false for all tokens to disable autofill using tokens. ALOT can and
 * will always be used for this purpose.
